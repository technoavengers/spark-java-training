 * In this program:
 * The user is presented with a menu to check the balance, make a deposit, make a withdrawal, or exit the program.
 * The while loop continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit (isRunning becomes false).
 * User input is obtained using the Scanner class.
 * The program validates input, performs transactions, and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
 * The user can repeatedly check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the program.
